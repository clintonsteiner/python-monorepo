The Name
--------

When it came time to name this Python monorepo, all the good names were already taken on PyPI.
You know how it is - every sensible, descriptive name for a utilities package has been claimed
long ago.

So instead of settling for something like ``super-utils-2-electric-boogaloo`` or
``yet-another-python-tools``, this project is named after **Hildie**, the goodest dog.

Who is Hildie?
--------------

Hildie is a very good dog who clearly deserves to have a Python package named after her.
Unlike most package names, "Hildie" was available, meaningful, and comes with the added
benefit of having an adorable mascot.

The Project
-----------

Despite its unconventional naming origin, Hildie is a serious Python monorepo containing
various utilities and tools for:

- Archiving Git fork repositories
- Command-line interface utilities
- Application helpers
- Core library functions

Built with modern Python tooling including Bazel, uv, and pytest, Hildie aims to be a
well-structured and maintainable collection of reusable Python code.

Philosophy
----------

If all the good names are taken, why not name your project after something that actually
matters? Hildie the dog > generic-python-utils any day.
